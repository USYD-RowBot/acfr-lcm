To use the process manager form the Bot library you need to run the deputy on the node
that is to run the LCM processes as well as a sherrif to start the processes.

A system can have only one running sherrif (unless the sherrif is in observer mode) but can
have multiple deputies.

To start a deputy
# bot-procman-deputy 2> /dev/null &

The deputy can execute programs in path.  

The sherrif on the slave node should be started with a script and told to exit once
the script has completed
# bot-procman-sheriff -n --on-script-complete exit /home/auv/git/acfr_lcm/config/procman/procman-serpent.cfg serpent

where procman-serpent.cfg is the serpent specific process scripts and serpent is the name of the script to execute.

An example starting script is in 
git/acfr_lcm/scripts/start_lcm_serpent.sh


To monitor the processes from another node you need to have an LCM tunnel and be running the 
sherrif.  The LCM tunnel needs to pass the PMD.* messages.  You should not pass any messages that are not needed
so as to not use excessive bandwidth as depending on the setup may be very limited.

# bot-lcm-tunnel -r PMD.* -s PMD.* -u <node> &
# bot-procman-sherriff

Where <node> is the name of the target running the deputy.  Multiple LCM tunnels can be started if there
are multiple targets.  An example start script is in 
git/acfr_lcm/scripts/start_lcm_serpent.sh
