RUNNING MISSIONS
* start vmware (xp)
* start Ocean Server/VectorMap
* plan mission
* explorer to //192.168.154.80
* copy new missions and srp to Missions directory on vehicle

* rdesktop 192.168.154.80

* click on 'ACFR stereo linux shell' terra term
* should automatically log into our linux box
* test cameras 
    - cam-test
    - > e1 (starts trigger)
    - > e0 (stops trigger)
    - > q (quit)

* start UVC
* verify instrumentshttp://www.linuxmint.com/start/maya
* check manual control
    
* > ssh -YC 172.16.154.206 (to yellowbox)
* > ~/start_lcm
* > bot-procman-sheriff
* > cd git/maptracker
* > ./start_webserver.py acfrauv

* Check connection to server from Collins
* Firefox to 172.16.154.206:8080
    
ABORT MISSION
* > git/acfr_lcm/mission/uvc_stop.py *should* send a stop message to the vehicle.  This should work if a tunnel is set up but should also work over the acoustic link.  This has not been tested.

CHECKING IMAGES OVER WIFI
* open redesktop session to 192.168.154.80
* open explorer window to acfr_server/data
* find images to look at and copy to local Images directory
* in VM on Collins open explorer to //192.168.154.80/Images and copy images to local directory (using the mapped directory for the host OS - I was putting them in ~/Downloads)
* use Geeqie to look at the images and Gimp to edit them and do an auto equalise 
DOWNLOAD and PROCESSING
* ~/git/scripts/lcmdata/getlcmdata.sh
* ~/git/scripts/lcmdata/processlcmdata.sh
*   - lcm2raw (can also run lcmlog-export -m /media/data/RAW_DATA/<campaign>/<dive>/r*.lcm to generate csv files that can be loaded into Matlab)
*   - images_pixel
*   - slam
*   - mesh
* To set up on a new machine, you need to have a <machine name>.cfg file in the cfgs/servers directory.  You also need an iverAME.cfg in cfgs/platforms.  This is on Collins but appears not have been checked in.  To set up another laptop it's probably best to ensure the iverAME.cfg is added to git.
* You also need default files for slam and the stereo calibration.  These shoud go in default_cfgs/default_config_hh.  The script will prompt for which config files to use.

CAPTURINGS IMAGES FOR A CALIBRATION
* Create a directory under /media/data/r<date_time>_calibration
* > ~/git/acfr_lcm/src/acfr/python/cam_control path /media/data/r<date_time>_calibration
* > ~/git/acfr_lcm/src/acfr/python_cam_control start
* > cam-test
* - > e1 (to start caputring images)
* - > e0 (to stop caputring images)
* - > q (to quit)
* > ~/git/acfr_lcm/src/acfr/python_cam_control stop
    
DEBUG TOOLS
* > cd git/acfr_lcm/build
* > bin/perls-core-spy
* > bot-procman-sheriff
* Set up  tunnel through Windows machine to get lcm-tunnel set up over wifi
