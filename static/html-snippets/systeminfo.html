            This page allows you to checkout the underwater robots in action!
            Right now a team of robotics engineers and scientists are using robots to gather underwater images and oceanographic data.

            This data is used for many purposes, including change detection, monitoring biodiversity, environmental impact assessments, etc...
        </p>
        <p>
            The robots collect huge amounts of data. The data is typically labeled by marine scientist but there is too much to
            label it all manually. We use the relatively few labels we get from marine scientist to train computer algorithms to classify the data.
            The more labels we get, the better the classifier becomes... That's where you can help!

            This system was developed to track multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) during field ops.
            It provides real-time updates of the locations of all the platforms relative to the ships and / or work boats that
            deploy them. It allows for custom or pre-existing map layers to be loaded both online and offline which allows for
            the easy identification of hazards and provide a pretty backdrop to the map.
