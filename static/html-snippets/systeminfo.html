<b><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Real-time Field Robot Tracker</b>
<p>
    This system was developed to track multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) during field ops.
    It provides real-time updates of the locations of all the platforms relative to the ships and / or work boats that
    deploy them. It allows for custom or pre-existing map layers to be loaded both online and offline which allows for
    the easy identification of hazards and provide a pretty backdrop to the map.
