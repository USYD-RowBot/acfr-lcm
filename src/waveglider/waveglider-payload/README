The protocol is documented in Chapter 8 of the liquid robotics handbook (ICD SV2 REV C was the source used here).

Issues with explanations in the handbook:
  - the Request ID is sent repeatedly... every N seconds (where N is configurable)
    as yet unsure whether it continues until a reply is given or just indefinitely
  - the checksum algorithm they use is CRC16-IBM/ANSI. The algorithm they supply appears
    to not work with a direct copy from C# to C/C++. Copies online that work can be found
    and may use the 0x8005 polynomial instead of the reversed 0xA001 from their algorithm.
