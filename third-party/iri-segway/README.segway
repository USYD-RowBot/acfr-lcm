FAQ

Q: How to install the libftd2xx.so library?

A: The Instructions provided by the manufacturer are a good point to
start, but they are incomplete. For completeness, all the necessary
steps are listed below:

* Download and extract the .tar.gz file into a temporal folder (for
  example ~/temp/)

* Copy the shared library file (libftd2xx.so.0.4.16) into the
  /usr/local/lib folder. This action requires root privileges:

> sudo cp libftd2xx.so.0.4.16 /usr/local/lib

* It is necessary to create two soft links to this library in order to
  work properly. From the /usr/local/lib folder and as root, execute
  the following commands:

> cd /usr/local/lib
> sudo ln -s libftd2xx.so.0.4.16 libftd2xx.so.0
> sudo ln -s libftd2xx.so.0 libftd2xx.so

* It is also necessary to create a soft link to this library into the
  /usr/lib folder. Again, as root, from the /usr/lib folder, execute
  the following command:

> cd /usr/lib
> sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.0.4.16 libftd2xx.so

* Next, copy all the header files from the temporal folder where the
  library has been extracted into the /usr/local/include folder. The
  files that need to be copied are ftd2xx.h and WinTypes.h. This
  action also requires root privileges:

> cd ~/temp
> cp *.h /usr/local/include

* In kernels previous to the 2.6.31 it is necessary to modify the
  fstab file to complete the installation. For the instructions for
  newer kernels, see the next answer in this section. As root, edit
  the fstab file in the /etc folder and add the following line at the
  end:

none    /proc/bus/usb   usbfs   defaults,devmode=0666   0       0

* Finally, remount all the devices in the ftsab file executing the
  following command as root:

> sudo mount -a

If this last command returns an error, follow the instructions in the
following answer.


Q: How to use the FTDI driver without root privileges in kernels
2.6.31 and newer?

A: Ubuntu distributions with kernels starting from 2.6.31 no longer
use mount the usb devices on /proc/bus/usb, and also, some
distributions no longer support the usbfs file system. If so, the
following error will appear when following the manufacturer's
instructions:

mount: mount point /proc/bus/usb does not exist

In this case, follow the following steps:

* Follow the manufacturer's instructions up to the point of modifying
  the /etc/fstab file.

* Instead of modifying the /etc/fstab file, it is necessary to include
  a new rule in the udev server. To do that, as root, create a new
  file in the /etc/udev/rules folder:

 cd /etc/udev/rules.d 

 sudo vim 99-ftdi.rules 

(both the priority and the name can be changed)

* Copy the following line into the previous file:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb|usb_device", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", GROUP="dialout"

* Re-start the udev service to take into account the changes:

sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart

* Other FTDI devices have different product id, so it will be
  necessary to include a rule for each of them. The standard product
  id's are: 6001, 6010 and 6006.
