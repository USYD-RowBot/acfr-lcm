When compiling perls for the first time, the cmake build environment
will set the BUILD_THIRD_PARTY option to "ON". This will result in
each of the third-party libraries residing in this directory to be
built and installed.  For each library that is built, a
.PERLS_CMAKE_BUILD_xxx hidden file is created; this allows cmake to
keep track of which libraries have already been built so that it does
not attempt to recompile them again.  If for some reason you do wish
to force cmake to rebuild a library, simple delete the corresponding
.PERLS_CMAKE_BUILD_xxx hidden file, set the BUILD_THIRD_PARTY option
to "ON" in cmake, and recompile.

SIFTGPU

1) If you have a graphic card with GPU, and want to use it for
feature extraction enable the BUILD_SIFTGPU option.

2) If your graphic card is Nvidia, modify x server setting to have max
performance to maximize the siftgpu speed

e.g., ubuntu
System > Administration > NVIDIA X Server settings

In GPU setting > PowerMizer > Prefered mode = Maximum performace
